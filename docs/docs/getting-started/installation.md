# Installation

Fetchy can be installed by downloading a pre-built release or building from source.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **npm** (included with Node.js) or **yarn**

Verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version  # should be >= 18.0.0
```

---

## Option 1: Download the Installer (Recommended)

Download the latest pre-built release from GitHub:

👉 [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/AkinerAlkan94/fetchy/releases)

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `Fetchy Setup x.x.x.exe` (NSIS installer) |
| macOS | `.dmg` file |
| Linux | `.AppImage` file |

---

## Option 2: Build from Source

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkinerAlkan94/fetchy.git
cd fetchy
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run in development mode

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

This starts both the Vite dev server and Electron simultaneously. Hot-reload is enabled.

### 4. Build for production

```bash
npm run electron:build
```

After building, find the installer in the `release/` folder:

```
release/
├── Fetchy Setup x.x.x.exe    # Windows installer
├── Fetchy-x.x.x.dmg          # macOS
└── Fetchy-x.x.x.AppImage     # Linux
```

| `npm run dev` | Run Vite dev server only (browser) |
| `npm run electron:dev` | Run Electron + Vite simultaneously |
| `npm run electron:build` | Build and package the app |

## First Launch

When Fetchy launches for the first time, you will be prompted to:

2. The workspace directories will be created on your filesystem

Your API data is stored as plain JSON files in the directories you choose.
